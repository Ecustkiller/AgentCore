"""SSE event-shape tests for the cost fields added to message_end / run_completed.

Pins the wire contract the client folds: the turn total cost rides on
``message_end`` (with the cache split now exposed in usage), and each finished
run lights up a payroll row via ``run_completed`` carrying role / model / usage /
cost. Both completion events stay back-compatible (new fields are additive).
