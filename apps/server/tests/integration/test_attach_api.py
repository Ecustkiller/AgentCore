"""Integration tests for the re-attach stream endpoint (执行与请求解耦 C1 · slice 1b).

Auto-skips (via the shared ``client`` fixture) when no PostgreSQL is reachable.
Covers auth, ownership (IDOR), the 204 "nothing live" fallback, and the core
replay-then-tail behaviour against a stand-in detached run registered directly in
the ``TurnRunRegistry`` (the full SSE turn is exercised elsewhere) — so this
isolates the route + ``EventSink.take_over`` contract: a re-attaching client
replays the transcript so far, then follows new events live.

    loop so ``session_factory``'s get_db override + its engine stay valid and the

    Why a live server: the attach stream test needs a *real* TCP disconnect. The
    in-memory ASGITransport the other tests use never delivers http.disconnect, so
    leaving an infinite SSE tail there deadlocks the stream exit; closing a real socket
    makes uvicorn cancel the attach generator for real.

    ``lifespan="off"`` matches what every other integration test already gets — the
    ASGITransport ``client`` never runs lifespan either — and the attach route needs
    only routing + get_db + the in-memory registry, not the boot probes / sweep loops.
    Crucially it also avoids ``setup_logging()`` (lifespan's first line) re-binding
    structlog mid-suite, which would otherwise strand capsys-based logging assertions
    in later tests.
