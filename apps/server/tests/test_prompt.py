"""Tests for system-prompt assembly (`assemble_system_prompt`) and the slim CEO core.

Pins two things:

1. The shared <output_style> contract that keeps the whole team's voice professional
   and anti-"AI slop" — it lives in the base prompt, so it must reach both the CEO
   chat agent and every delegated worker, and survive the optional memory /
   attachment-context sections layered on top. (<tool_safety> used to be shared here
   too, but 按角色 right-size 反向 moved it onto the worker identities — the coordinator
   CEO holds only read-only tools — so this file pins its ABSENCE from the base/CEO
   path; the worker-side presence is pinned in tests/runs_executor/test_identities.py.)
2. The SLIM CEO core (提示词瘦身 P2): ``_CEO_CORE_HINT`` keeps only the always-on
   routing spine (tool boundary / split criterion / hidden-context rule / same-layer
   pipeline / synthesize-don't-restate) + a pointer to ``consult_skill`` and the
   能力目录. The rarely-used「怎么做」detail (multi-round debate / nested delegation /
   asking the user / revise) is moved into system Skills
   (runtime/skills.py, see test_skills.py) — so it must NOT ride the core every turn.
