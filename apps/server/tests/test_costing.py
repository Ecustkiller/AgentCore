"""Unit tests for the per-run cost ledger builders (runtime/costing.py).

Pure and DB-free: they pin how a finished run becomes a ``cost_events`` row.
Both a delegated member and the captain root read the price the executor already
stamped onto their ``RunState`` (neither is re-priced — pricing happens once, in
the executor, via :func:`calculate_cost`); these builders only reshape that priced
state into a ledger row. Money is integer nano-USD throughout.
