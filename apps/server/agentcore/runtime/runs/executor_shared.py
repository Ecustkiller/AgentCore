    each assistant tool-call turn + tool results), then append the final assistant
    answer so the transcript ends with the worker's product.

    This is the shared core of both the initial worker run and a 续写 (auto-rework /
    revise): ``react_loop`` returns the final no-tool answer WITHOUT appending it
    (engine returns before the append), so we add it here — making ``messages`` a
    complete, replayable transcript for capture and continuation.

    Returns the loop's full ``reasoning`` alongside ``content`` so the caller can
    carry it onto the worker's terminal :class:`RunState` → its ``message_final``
    fact (执行级事件溯源: deltas 退场). The worker's thinking is the run's authoritative
    fact there; ``run_reasoning_delta`` stays as a transport-only live signal (no
    longer journaled), exactly like ``run_output_delta`` / ``run_tool_progress``.

    ``usage_sink`` is forwarded to the loop so that when this pass raises (workers
    run with ``raise_on_error=True``), the caller can still read the tokens spent on
    the rounds that completed before the failure (B-deep 失败计费).

    ``streamed_content`` (run_redirect 热续写): when given, each ``run_output_delta``
    chunk is also appended here so a mid-flight cancel can salvage the draft the
    user already saw even before the final assistant turn is appended to ``messages``.

    ``finish_override_sink`` mirrors the captain path: when the loop ends on a
    non-default terminal (ERROR / DEGRADED from an aborted LLM stream, …) the
    reason is appended so the worker executor can surface a soft warning instead of
    silently treating the run as a clean COMPLETED.

    ``cutoff_reason_sink`` collects structured pinch codes (e.g. ``token_budget``)
