    The captain is the turn's root Run node: unlike a delegated worker it owns the
    conversation voice (its content/reasoning stream to the chat bubble via the
    engine's default ``content_delta`` / ``reasoning_delta``, NOT run-scoped), runs
    the ``chat`` profile, holds the read/retrieval tools + ``delegate``, and writes
    the user-facing reply (possibly after delegating). It shares the one
    ``react_loop`` assembly with workers; only the message build + output routing +
    cost role differ. It runs directly (not via the WaveScheduler — it is the root
    that *calls* delegate, which schedules the children), so it takes no
    ``completed`` deps map.

    The captain's run lifecycle (``run_started`` / ``run_completed`` role=captain)
    is emitted so the graph has a real root 汇聚点 (declared in the delegate batch's
    ``run_plan``); a non-delegating turn emits them too but, lacking a ``run_plan``,
    they are dropped client-side and never journaled into a graph. Priced once here
    (``state.cost``) so the captain payroll row shows real cost; the pipeline reads
    that into the captain ledger row (no re-price).
