    The factory mints this in the tools layer so ``runs`` stays free of a concrete
    tools dependency (it only touches the opaque :class:`~agentcore.tools.protocol.Tool`
    objects + the ``dispose`` closure here):

    - ``tools`` — the lead's own ``delegate`` PLUS the companion ``replan`` bound to
      THAT delegate instance. Both ride the opening table (prefix cache). Idle
      ``replan`` fails at execute until a nested sub-plan exists.
      Wiring ``replan`` for a lead (not just the root CEO) is the 去特例 fix: a lead
      supervises its own sub-plan's 波边界 (子队员 escalate scope)
      exactly like the CEO — without it a yielding sub-plan would be a dead-end.
    - ``tool_names`` — re-grant those names on a least-privilege allow-list (mirrors
      how ``escalate`` is kept callable for a restricted worker).
    - ``dispose`` — turn-end disposition of a sub-plan the lead yielded but never
      resumed (堵漏账): fold its completed workers' usage/ledger/citations in before
      the parent absorbs this child, so a lead that wrapped up without a ``replan``
      never strands sub-team spend. No-op when nothing is paused; best-effort.
