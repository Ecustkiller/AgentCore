"""RunSession — a recoverable snapshot of a finished worker run (留人).

The substrate of 定向唤回（乙 热修）: when a worker run completes, its full message
transcript is preserved as a :class:`RunSession` so the SAME author can be recalled
to continue on its own draft (统一「续写」原语) instead of re-delegating a cold new
worker. The :class:`~agentcore.runtime.sessions.SessionStore` holds the live roster;
the executor's ``continue_run`` re-runs a session with an appended instruction.

    role / model tier / allowed tools / contract), so a continuation runs as the
    same author under the same policy. ``recall_count`` is how many times this run
    has been revised (the 改次闸 reads it). ``content`` mirrors the latest answer
    for quick display.

    ``partial`` marks a mid-flight salvage from a redirect cancel (尚未 COMPLETED、
