"""Run model type core (统一 Run 模型 第一阶段) — the typed substrate the scheduler
and executor build on.

A turn holds one *tree* of Runs: the ``CAPTAIN`` root is the CEO chat loop (the
reply engine); every delegated worker / DAG node is an ``AGENT`` child. This module
fixes the *shape* of a Run
— its spec (:class:`RunSpec`) +
node policy (:class:`RunPolicy`) + live state (:class:`RunState`) — and the phases
it moves through (:class:`RunPhase`). The plan that holds nodes lives in
``runs.plan``; the scheduler that drives them in ``runs.wave``.

第一阶段范围：worker 以「内联角色」声明（无独立 Agent 实体），因此 ``RunSpec`` 直接携带
角色/目标/工具/模型档位等执行所需字段；``agent_id`` 在本阶段即等于 ``run_id``（事件与图
节点标识沿用），``agent_name`` 取角色名做展示。RunPolicy 中的审计/契约/best-of-N 择优
（``candidates``）等槽位先声明、暂不启用，留给阶段2。
