"""Run-tree concurrency budget (ContextVar).

Root CEO fan-out still **分而不乘**: each :class:`WaveScheduler` divides
``current_budget`` by its dispatch width (:func:`child_budget`) and installs the
share on child tasks, so a wide root wave does not pretend every child still
holds the full knobs.

Product nested ``delegate`` (depth≥1) **reseeds full** via
:func:`reseed_nested_delegation_budget` before the nested scheduler runs — each
sub-team schedules against ``engine_max_parallel_delegations`` so a 4-wide nest
is not starved to ``12//N`` by sibling leads. Safe because nesting is hard-capped
at ``MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH`` (3) and per-lead spawn at ``MAX_WORKER_SUBDELEGATIONS``.
Raw WaveScheduler-in-WaveScheduler without a reseed still divides (unit tests).
