# N×4000 unbounded). Sized to align with the CEO's own delegate-output budget
# (tools/builtin/delegate.py ``_DELEGATE_OUTPUT_LIMIT`` = 16000): a downstream writer
# synthesizing upstream research deserves as much context as the CEO synthesizing the
# batch. Replaces the old 4000 cap, which starved a research→writer chain — a long
# upstream was head-truncated, silently dropping its tail (金额 / 法条编号). When a dep
# must still be trimmed it is HEAD+TAIL truncated (`runs/fidelity.py truncate_head_tail`),

# ``file_read`` — instead of the whole product re-shipped through the prompt. The
# artifact is on disk and reachable; re-injecting it whole wastes tokens and risks
# tail-trimming (the budgeted full-text path). These bound the pointer: how far the
# prose digest is cut, and how many paths to list before eliding. A pointer dep does

# fan-in (all workers → the CEO's overview pass) instead of (a worker's deps → it). The
# motive is correctness, not only cost: an unbounded aggregate would hit the single
# ToolResult output_limit net and, by middle-elision, drop whole workers from the middle
# (防幻觉铁律 / 收尾指引 at the tail now survive — ToolResult keeps head+tail — but a
# worker silently vanishing from the synthesis input is still wrong). File-producers
# (digested — their full product is on disk + shown in the UI) don't draw on this pool.
