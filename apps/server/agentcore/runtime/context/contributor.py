"""PromptContributor — the uniform "plugin" shape every always-on prompt source takes.

上下文注入统一 Step 2（常驻源插件化）. Step 1 centralized the *assembly* (ContextAssembler);
this gives every always-on source — base prompt, runtime context, memory ``<rules>``, CEO
core, skill directory, citation hint, workspace overview, per-turn attachment — ONE shape:
a named fragment + its render ``order`` + an optional ``budget``. So:

- ordering is DECLARATIVE in one place (:class:`SectionOrder`), not implicit in the
  ``.add()`` call sequence at each site, and
- the future budget / eviction lever (文档「扳机 B」) reads ``budget`` off the contributor
  instead of needing N scattered call sites to grow a budget argument.

Eager by design: the owner computes ``text`` (some sources are async, e.g. the workspace
overview) and hands the finished string here — this is a descriptor, not a lazy renderer.
A falsy ``text`` (None / "") means "this source contributes nothing this turn" and is
dropped, exactly as the prior ``if part: parts.append(part)`` guards did.
