    """Run the ReAct loop.

    Returns ``(final_content, final_reasoning, usage, rounds)`` where ``usage`` is
    the turn's :class:`TokenUsage` summed across every round (carrying the
    cache_hit/cache_miss split so cost stays honest on multi-turn chats — a single
    object instead of loose ints). ``final_reasoning`` is the concatenated
    thinking text across all rounds (empty when thinking is disabled), mirroring
    what was streamed via ``reasoning_delta`` so it can be persisted for replay.

    The ``profile`` drives both the model params and the round budget
    (``profile.max_rounds``); it defaults to the chat profile. By
    default content/reasoning deltas are emitted as conversation events
    (single-agent path). A caller running a multi-agent run passes ``on_content``
    /``on_reasoning`` to redirect text into ``run_output_delta`` instead, and
    ``on_tool_progress`` to surface a worker's tool-call ARGUMENT streaming
    (``(tool_name, cumulative_chars)``, throttled) — the only live signal during a
    long file write, which is neither content nor reasoning.
    ``on_reset`` mirrors that redirection for every draft-discard reset: the
    default clears the CEO bubble (``content_reset``); a worker passes ``on_reset``
    to clear its run card (``run_output_reset``) instead — so the rewrite replaces
    the discarded draft cleanly on whichever surface streamed it (统一底线). It takes
    the ``ResetReason`` (finish_guard / retry / soft_gate / narration / ask_user) —
    each emit site states WHY, and folds render the rework chip only for finish_guard.
    ``on_round_begin`` (when provided) is called at the top of every round AFTER the
    first; the messages it returns are appended to the window before that round's LLM
    call. A generic「inject context that accrued while the run was working」hook — a
    delegated worker wires it to pull teammates' freshly-posted 便签 (§2.2 通·便签墙)
    so the team builds on each other's evolving work; ``None`` (CEO / solo / tests) is a
    no-op. The engine only appends what it returns — the caller owns the semantics.
    ``allowed_tool_names`` filters which tools the model may call and execute
    (schema offer + ``execute_tools`` enforce; ``None`` = all,
    ``[]`` = none). Tool execution events always go to the sink. When
    ``citation_sink`` is provided, web sources consulted by research tools are
    aggregated into it (de-duped, capped) for the caller to surface/persist.
    ``turn_evidence_ledger`` (调研路径) registers hits into the turn-shared ledger
    and annotates tool output with stable ``#rN=url`` for CEO and workers alike
    (引用即出处 P1). ``annotate_citations`` gates finish_guard's legacy ``[n]`` check
    (CEO True / worker False)；``#rN`` id 存在闸在台账接通且正文出现约定标记时启用
    （Q5；worker 回炉 1 次 / CEO 跟配置）。without a ledger the old ``[n]=url``
    annotate path still applies. Debate speakers omit the turn ledger (场级 ``#e``).
    ``approval_gate`` (CEO chat path only; ``None`` for delegated workers) pauses
    GRANTABLE tool calls until the user authorizes them — a denial is fed back to
    the model as a tool result so it can adapt.
    ``usage_sink`` (when provided) mirrors the running ``total_usage`` after each
    completed round, so a caller that catches an exception can still bill the
    tokens consumed before the failure (B-deep 失败计费): on ``raise_on_error`` the
    accumulated usage is otherwise lost inside this frame when a mid-loop round
    raises. It is cleared on entry and only ever holds the latest cumulative total
    (a single-element list); on a normal return the caller uses the returned usage
    instead.
    ``finish_override_sink`` (when provided, CEO captain path) is an out-param
    mirroring the ``usage_sink`` idiom: it carries a single :class:`FinishReason`
    the caller should stamp on the turn instead of the rounds-derived default
    (``end_turn`` / ``max_rounds``). The loop sets it to ``DEGRADED`` when the model
    keeps returning empty responses past the threshold, or ``UNPRODUCTIVE``
    when it early-stops a run of all-tools-failed-no-content rounds (B2). Cleared on
    entry; left empty on a normal finish (one channel, since a run takes at most one
    such terminal path).

    ``run_id`` / ``role`` scope the execution-level facts (§8.3) this loop records
    into the turn's ambient :data:`~agentcore.runtime.facts.current_fact_log`
    (round_boundary / llm_call / note) — captain vs worker, so a multi-agent turn's
    facts split per run. They default to empty (a standalone loop / test records
    facts with no scope, or none at all when no log is bound).

    ``deliverable_only`` makes the RETURNED ``final_content`` the 交付正文 only — the
    prose a round streams BEFORE a *non-terminal* tool call is treated as PROCESS
    narration ("我先查一下" / an acknowledgement of an injected ``[系统提示]`` steer)
    and rolled back off the accumulator (mirroring the finish_guard ``Rework``
    rollback), so it never accrues into the persisted product / next-turn history /
    CEO synthesis input — **unless every tool in that round failed**, in which case
    the prose is kept (already streamed to the user; not a successful lead-in).
    It is always journaled per round (llm_call fact → 旁白入 journal). Two display
    disciplines by channel架构:

    - CEO captain (``on_reset`` is None → default ``content_delta`` / ``content_reset``):
      the narration STAYS streamed + visible in the SEPARATE process timeline
      (透明可见); only ``messages.content`` (旁路 conformance) is trimmed. No reset.
    - worker / debater / revision (``on_reset`` routes ``run_output_reset``, and the
      card replays from the ``message_final`` fact — a SINGLE display+data channel):
      the narration rollback ALSO emits ``run_output_reset`` to clear the streamed
      draft off the card, so 直播 == the rolled-back deliverable == 重载 (synthesized
      from ``message_final``) — the conformance invariant.

    Terminal rounds (handoff / suspend checkpoints other than blocking ``ask_user``)
    KEEP their pre-tool text — that IS the deliverable at that boundary. Blocking
    ``ask_user`` absorbs same-round prose into the card instead (see
    ``ask_user_absorb``). Default ``False`` leaves the
    accumulation byte-identical to before (standalone loops / tests).

    ``gate_escalation_sink`` (Worker routing Phase 1): when provided, each tool round
    runs the Escalation Gate after ``execute_tools`` (execution-layer only; no free-text
    scheme scan). Structured thrashing / escalate rows may still append here and emit
    ``run_escalation_gate``. CEO / solo leave it ``None`` (gate inert).

    ``token_budget`` (Worker hard ceiling · loose backstop): a cumulative
    input+output token cap for the whole run, checked at the TOP of each round. Once
    ``total_usage.total_tokens`` reaches it the loop stops and force-finalizes — the
    backstop against a worker blowing past the configured unified ceiling. The
    terminal finalize (this AND ``max_rounds`` exhaustion) is gate-routed by run
    health (``controller.is_thrashing()``): an on-track run delivers normally; a
    thrashing worker finishes DEGRADED and emits an observable ``escalation_raised``
    signal (no auto re-decompose — the CEO may voluntarily replan). ``0`` (CEO /
    solo / tests / ceiling disabled) disables the backstop, leaving the run bounded
    only by ``profile.max_rounds``.

    ``controller_seed`` (resume path): optional JSON-safe latch snapshot from a prior
    ``turn_paused.controller``; omitted on a fresh turn (behaviour unchanged).

    ``tool_failure_sink``: when given, replaced at every terminal exit with this run's
    tool-failure fact dicts (same tally as the circuit breaker — for RunState / CEO).

    ``controller_seed_sink``: when given, replaced at every terminal exit with this
    run's :meth:`LoopController.export_seed` snapshot so a follow-up pass
    (write_pass / light_repair / contract retry) can restore validation path-stop
    memory across a fresh controller.
