"""User checkpoint coordination — the CEO pausing a turn to ask the user.

The ask_user checkpoint's typed result, settled over the unified interaction
bridge (``runtime/interaction.py``), alongside tool approvals
(``runtime/approvals.py``) and local-workspace ops (``workspace/channel.py``). A
GRANTABLE tool approval carries a one-shot *decision*; a checkpoint carries the
user's answer to a question the CEO raised mid-turn (continue / adjust / stop).

Unlike approvals and ops (pure transport), a checkpoint's question + answer are
journaled to the turn_journal table (see ``events._JOURNAL_EVENT_TYPES``) and
projected into the assistant message's runs payload, so a reload replays the
exchange inline — it is part of the conversation, not just gating.

State is in-process (single-worker posture, same as the approval gate); front
with Redis to scale to multiple workers (see ``config.py``).
