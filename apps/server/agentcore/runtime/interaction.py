"""Unified interaction primitive — the one suspend-resume bridge (§8.2 / §8.6).

Hot-path kinds (approval / delegation_authorization / escalation / client_tool) share
ONE in-process :class:`InteractionRegistry`: the engine task awaits an
:class:`asyncio.Future`; a separate HTTP request (the unified resolve endpoint) settles
it. Cold-path kinds (``ask_user`` / ``plan_review`` / ``team_preview``) do **not** await
here — they finalize the turn onto a durable frame and continue via ``POST .../resume``.
``stage_card`` / ``question_posted`` are journaled surfaces without a bridge Future.

This is the §8.6 **ClientRequestBridge** port (Protocol in ``runtime/ports.py``):
one pending registry → one ``list_pending`` → one resolve endpoint for hot-path kinds.
Per-kind differences (the typed result; whether the exchange is journaled) stay in the
thin typed faces: :class:`~agentcore.runtime.approvals.ApprovalGate`,
:class:`~agentcore.tools.builtin.ask_user.AskUserTool` (cold resume, no registry),
:class:`~agentcore.workspace.channel.WorkspaceChannel`.

State is in-process (single-worker posture, like the rate limiter — see
``config.py``); front with Redis to scale to multiple workers. Each request is
tagged with its ``conversation_id`` so a resolve aimed at another conversation is
refused (defense in depth on top of the route's ownership check — the request id is
otherwise the only key).
