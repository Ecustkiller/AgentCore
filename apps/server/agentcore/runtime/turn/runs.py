"""In-process registry of active chat-turn runs (执行与请求解耦 C1 · slice 1a).

Background — why this exists
---------------------------
A chat turn used to be bound to its SSE request: the route spawned the pipeline as
a ``producer`` task and the SSE layer cancelled it the instant the client
disconnected. That coupling lost the most painful real case (实测案例复盘 案例 1: a
7-minute 法律论文 turn dropped its connection and the whole delivery was thrown
away). To decouple execution from the request, the turn now runs as a *detached*
task tracked here, keyed by ``conversation_id``; the SSE layer only ATTACHES to it.

Resulting lifecycle
-------------------
- **client disconnect** → the SSE stream detaches, but the run keeps going and
  persists its reply in the background (断线不再丢交付).
- **explicit stop** (``POST .../stop``) → :meth:`stop` cancels the run task, which
  unwinds through the turn's existing ``CancelledError`` salvage (finished team
  work is kept as an incomplete message).
- **lifespan shutdown** → :func:`salvage_turns_on_shutdown` marks clean-cancel,
  cascade-stops every live run, awaits unwind (grace timeout), then force-releases
  leftover leases — never the sweeper orphan path.
- **normal completion** → the task's done-callback drops it from the registry.

Posture
-------
This registry is the **process-local cache** of live tasks + sinks. Durable RUNNING
ownership lives in ``turn_leases`` (Postgres; heartbeat + owner) so a process restart
no longer silently drops in-flight turns — the lease sweeper claims expired rows and
routes them through ``recover_turn``. Reconnect (``EventSink.take_over`` / ``detach``)
and stop stay orthogonal to recover. Cross-process Redis lease backend is a later
swap behind the same repository seam.
