"""Execution-level Turn Journal facts (§18.3) — the schema + the engine's write port.

The §18.3 Turn Journal is a turn's 唯一事实源: an append-only, per-turn ordered
stream of facts from which everything replayable / resumable is a projection. The
conceptual model is nine fact kinds::

    turn_started | round_boundary | llm_call | tool_call | interaction
                 | note | run_event | message_final | turn_end

Today the journal is **display-level**: it is derived from the SSE stream
(``events._JOURNAL_EVENT_TYPES``), so it carries the team graph / tool cards /
interaction cards (the ``run_event`` / ``tool_call`` / ``interaction`` umbrellas,
stored under their SSE *event-type* kind) + a closing ``turn_end``. That is enough
to **show** a past turn but NOT to **rebuild the engine** (the LLM window, the pause
frame): the captain transcript never enters the stream, ``run_completed`` carries
only a summary, and the system prompt / injected nudges are not facts. Resume bridges
the gap with the旁路 ``paused_turns.frame``.

This module owns the **six execution-level facts** that close that gap (the new
kinds), making the journal lossless so the window / frame become projections of it
(执行级事件溯源落地设计.md):

- :class:`TurnStartedFact` — the turn's head: the *verbatim* system prompt, the user
  message, the model profile. Anchors the window fold (the system prompt is dynamic —
  date / skill directory — so it is captured, never re-rendered).
- :class:`RoundBoundaryFact` — one ReAct round edge (round_idx + run/role), the key
  ``round_boundary.fold`` cuts on to rebuild the pause snapshot per round.
- :class:`LlmCallFact` — one LLM call's **output** (content / reasoning_content /
  tool_calls / usage / finish_reason). Execution-保真 core: the call's *input* is
  never stored — it is the fold of all prior facts (correct-by-construction, no
  quadratic window duplication).
- :class:`ToolCallFact` — one completed tool call's **full model-facing result** (the
  text fed back into the window), captured AFTER any post-emit annotation (the CEO
  path folds citation numbers into the tool message after ``tool_use_end`` fires —
  Phase 2 边界①). The window fold reads tool results from THIS fact, not the forwarded
  display ``tool_use_end`` (whose ``result`` is the pre-annotation text). Carries
  ``run_id`` so a multi-agent turn's tools scope per run.
- :class:`NoteFact` — an engine-injected message (a convergence NUDGE reflection, the
  FINALIZE instruction): part of the real LLM window, so the fold needs it. Carries
  ``run_id`` (Phase 2 边界②) so a captain note injected mid-delegate (while a worker is
  the active run) is still attributed to the captain window.
- :class:`MessageFinalFact` — a run's / the turn's **full** output text (vs the
  ``run_completed`` summary), so resume feeds a worker's product back from facts
  rather than from the frame.

The remaining three kinds are sourced elsewhere: ``run_event`` / ``interaction`` keep
riding their SSE event-type entries (from the sink — incl. the display ``tool_use_start``
/ ``tool_use_end`` pair, which stays for the team-graph tool card), and ``turn_end``
stays in :mod:`agentcore.runtime.journal` (``KIND_TURN_END``). The display projection
(``runs_from_entries``) therefore must simply *ignore* the execution kinds
(:data:`EXECUTION_ONLY_KINDS`) so adding them never disturbs replay.

Pure schema + an in-memory recorder here: stdlib only, no DB, no engine import. The
durable side is the §18.6 ``Journal`` port (``db.repositories.TurnJournalRepository``);
a turn's :class:`TurnFactLog` is flattened to journal entries and persisted there at
turn end (and re-projected on read), exactly like the display journal today.
