"""TurnSuspension — the durable snapshot of a turn paused at a client checkpoint.

结构化挂起 2b (turn 级落盘 + ``POST .../resume``): 2a suspends a turn on an
*in-memory* Future — a process restart or client disconnect loses the whole turn
(an asyncio task + any already-finished workers). This module is the inert data
layer that makes that pause **durable**: a frozen frame carrying everything
``POST .../resume`` needs to rebuild and continue the turn on a fresh process.

Two suspend points are persisted, sharing one frame via a ``kind`` discriminated
union (base :class:`TurnSuspension` + :class:`PlanReviewSuspension` /
:class:`AskUserSuspension` / :class:`TeamPreviewSuspension`):

- **plan_review** — the ``WaveScheduler`` paused at a wave boundary after a
  ``checkpoint_after`` step (inside ``delegate``). Resume re-drives the remaining
    plan tail, feeds the workers' product back as the suspended ``delegate`` tool
  result, then continues the CEO loop. Carries only the reviewed ``steps`` / gated
  ``pending`` (display re-render): the ``plan`` (with minted run_ids) and the
  finished-worker ``completed`` seed are BOTH re-projected from the journal on resume
  (``plan_from_journal`` / ``completed_from_journal``), not serialized — 执行级事件溯源 Phase 2.
- **team_preview** — orchestration kickoff gate paused BEFORE fan-out /
  moderator start (``delegate`` workers or ``debate`` loop). Resume branches on
  ``primitive``: delegate uses ``delegate.resume_plan``; debate re-enters
  ``DebateTool.execute`` (skip kickoff). Carries workers (delegate) or
  motion/sides/budget (debate) plus optional capability ``tools``.
- **ask_user** — the CEO paused mid-loop on its ``ask_user`` checkpoint (the one
  asking primitive — opening 引导 or mid-task fork). Resume maps the user's answer
  to the ``ask_user`` tool result and continues the CEO loop (no plan tail). Carries
  the card payload (message / context / assumptions / questions / style_options) so
  resume can re-emit it.

Every frame shares: the CEO ``transcript`` at the pause (system + history + user +
the assistant message carrying the suspended tool_call), the ``tool_call_id`` that
result must echo (so the rebuilt transcript stays a valid tool-call/result pair),
the ``base_system_prompt`` + ``user_message`` (to re-wire the CEO toolset), and the
``checkpoint_id`` (so resume re-emits the resolution).

The journal-so-far is NOT in the frame: it is the §8.3 ``turn_journal`` (唯一事实源),
written at pause and re-hydrated onto :attr:`TurnSuspension.journal_entries` when the
resume claims the frame (see ``runtime/suspension_persistence.py``). The display
:attr:`TurnSuspension.journal` (the resume seed) is a DERIVED projection of those
entries — a property, never stored (P0-B Phase 3). The frame thus carries only the
resume *control* state, not a second copy of the replay stream.

The frame is captured by the suspending face (the ``delegate`` checkpoint hook /
``AskUserTool``) — both read the live CEO transcript off :data:`captain_transcript`,
published by the captain executor — and persisted by
``runtime/suspension_persistence.py``. Pure data + a contextvar here; no DB, no engine.
