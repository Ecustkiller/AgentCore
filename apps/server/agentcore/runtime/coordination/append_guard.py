"""Mid-coordination append overlap guard + C3 dispatch ownership.

When the live graph still has incomplete nodes, a secondary ``delegate`` that
claims the same **seat** (normalized role-name equality) is rejected.

**Seat model**: a seat is ``_norm_role(role)`` — whitespace-stripped lowercase
equality only. Shared job suffixes / CJK prefixes / edit distance do **not**
merge seats (痛点调研员 ≠ 定价调研员; 前端工程师 ≠ 测试工程师).

**Seat reclaim**: FAILED / CANCELLED / SKIPPED (vacated) **and** successfully
COMPLETED same-seat terminals auto-fill ``replaces_run_id`` when a new node
reclaims the seat with no incomplete same-seat peer (file lock transfer +
depends_on rewrite via the existing replaces pipeline). Still-running holders
keep the seat; overlap still rejects.

**C3 file side**: deliverable artifacts consult the session ownership ledger.
**Completed** holders of a declared path are **not** append-rejected — dispatch
``declare_plan_artifacts`` handoffs those paths to the new node (审校→修订 /
同岗位补派). Still-running / incomplete holders keep blocking. Role-only
overlap still requires incomplete live nodes.

Same-batch sibling artifact crosses are rejected at dispatch (name the pair),
**before** durable ``run_plan`` emit (admit → commit → execute).

Cross-turn ``append_to_execution_id`` admits the **new batch only** against the
host plan + journal completed seed (auto-``replaces`` on free seats) — never
sibling-scan host∪new as one batch.

``replan.adds`` on an active coordination live plan reuses the same admit
(``admit_added_nodes``) + ``declare_plan_artifacts`` path as append merge.

Ownership keys are **concrete file** ``artifacts`` only — directory prefixes /
``artifact_dir`` / globs are acceptance coverage, never exclusive claims.
