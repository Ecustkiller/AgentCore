"""DesktopBrowserBridge client credentials + health (Local browser_* gate · C1/C4).

**Control plane (B-Arch):** Desktop re-sends ``browserBridge: {baseUrl, token}`` on
each sidecar ``initialize`` / ``startTurn`` / ``resume`` (same pattern as inference
tokens). Sidecar applies them via :func:`apply_desktop_bridge_from_turn`, which
clears the health cache so a prior failed probe cannot stick for the process life.

Legacy fallback: if no turn override has been applied yet, read
``AGENTCORE_BROWSER_BRIDGE_URL`` / ``AGENTCORE_BROWSER_BRIDGE_TOKEN`` from the
environment (dev probes / older spawners). Production desktop no longer relies on
spawn-time env alone.

Healthy Bridge → ``browser_host_kind_for`` returns ``local``. Missing / unhealthy
Bridge does **not** keep tools withheld when gVisor/sandbox/netns is ready: that
path assembles ``host_kind=sandbox`` (云端过桥；API 够不到本机 loopback). C4 still
forbids mixing local+sandbox on one session — fallback is whole-session sandbox,
not a silent mid-session switch. True local engine with neither Bridge nor gVisor
still withholds (no fake success).

Tests inject via ``set_desktop_bridge_health_for_tests`` / ``apply_desktop_bridge_from_turn``.
