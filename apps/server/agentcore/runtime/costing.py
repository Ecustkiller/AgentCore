"""Per-call detail + per-run aggregate ledger shapes.
``CallCost`` → ``cost_calls`` (authority). ``RunCost`` → ``cost_events`` (per-run
materialized view the product surfaces read). Both carry structural ``role``

payroll derives from the same attribution fields on every path (cloud finalize

Money stays integer nano-USD throughout; pricing happens exactly once via

priced states / usages into ledger rows — it never re-prices.
Ledger routing by ``credential_source`` (on the priced ``Cost`` / cost dict):
platform/vendor → ``cost_total_nano`` (quota / admin); user → ``cost_estimated_nano``
(``cost_total_nano`` stays 0 so BYOK estimates never pollute ``enforce_quota``).
