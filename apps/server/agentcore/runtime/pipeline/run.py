    """Run the full chat pipeline for a single user message.

    Returns a dict with final_content, usage, and metadata.
    The sink receives all SSE events during execution.

    ``approvals_enabled`` gates GRANTABLE tools behind the user's consent (the
    default interactive path). It is set False for an autonomous local→云 handoff
    job (双模式工作区 P2e / e2): that run has no live client to answer prompts and
    operates on an isolated server sandbox, so — like cloud-mode workers — it needs
    no gate; leaving it on would deadlock every file/exec tool on a timeout-deny.

    ``memory_enabled`` is the user's long-term-memory master switch (resolved by the
    caller): False injects no memory <rules> this turn (Agent记忆与知识系统 §一).

    ``autonomy_policy`` is derived from the conversation's ``permission_preset``
    (安全权限与治理 · 会话级权限模式): observe→always_ask / workspace→first_grant /
    full_trust→full_auto. Only the capability-auth dimension — plan_review /
    checkpoint confirmation is unchanged.

    ``permission_preset`` (when set) also gates worker tool registration: observe
    withholds the execution class (``code_execute`` / ``test_run`` / ``terminal``).

    ``folder_id`` is the conversation's project (None for a bare/global chat): it selects
    the memory SCOPE so a project conversation also gets that project's memory layer
    injected (global + project), and ``consult_memory`` searches both (Agent记忆与知识系统 §二).

    ``board_id`` marks this turn as a 白板会话 (AI协作白板.md §六 M2): when set, the CEO
    gains the ``board_ops`` tool + a :class:`BoardChannel` bound to that board, so it can
    apply structured ops to the user's open whiteboard canvas. ``None`` for every ordinary
    chat — then ``board_ops`` is neither wired nor reachable.

    ``x_client_platform`` is the raw ``X-Client-Platform`` header (desktop / mobile-web /
    …). Gates ``ask_user``'s ``action=bind_local_folder`` advertisement and the
    ``<workspace_context>`` desktop-online line — cloud web/mobile must not see the bind
    action. ``None`` / absent defaults to desktop (legacy tests).

    ``profile_set`` is the turn's per-scenario model set — which model each scenario
    (chat / agent.strong / ...) runs this turn — resolved by the caller from the user's
    configured model. ``None`` (e.g. the autonomous handoff job) falls back to the
    default profile set.

    ``llm_credentials`` are the turn's resolved BYOK key + endpoint (config.
    billing_mode); the caller resolves them once (route preflight) and threads them
    here so the whole turn runs on the user's own DeepSeek quota. ``None`` falls
    back to the global server key (platform mode).
