"""Hooks for crash-lease recover (injection seam for production + tests).

Production installs :func:`agentcore.runtime.crash_delegate.production_crash_delegate_factory`
via ``set_crash_delegate_factory`` in the app lifespan. When the factory is unset
(tests / miswired boot), ``build_crash_delegate_tool`` warns and the sweeper
salvages to ``interrupted``. Unit tests may inject a fake tool to prove
``recover_turn`` seeds ``WaveScheduler``.
