"""Hooks for crash-lease recover (seam for tests / future full pipeline rebuild).

Building a live ``DelegateTool`` after a process death needs the same wiring as
resume (LLM, workspace backend, profiles, …). That full rebuild is a follow-on;
this module is the injection point. Production returns ``None`` until wired —
the sweeper still claims/releases leases and unit tests inject a fake tool to
prove ``recover_turn`` seeds ``WaveScheduler`` correctly.
