"""Sidecar entrypoint: ``python -m agentcore.sidecar``.

Runs the stdio JSON-RPC loop that the desktop drives. Two transport invariants
matter here and are set up before anything else:

1. **stdout is the JSON-RPC channel — nothing else may write to it.** Logging
   (and any stray ``print``) is redirected to stderr by pointing ``sys.stdout`` at
   ``sys.stderr`` *before* ``setup_logging`` runs (it binds its handler to the
   then-current ``sys.stdout``). The framed writer keeps a private handle to the
   real stdout.
2. **UTF-8 both ways.** Windows consoles default to a legacy code page; the streams
   are reconfigured to UTF-8 so non-ASCII content round-trips.

stdin is read line-by-line on a worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``) so the read
never blocks the event loop — ``respond`` / ``cancel`` stay serviceable while a
turn streams.
