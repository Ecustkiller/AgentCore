"""Sidecar local settlement prewrite (回合恢复状态机收口 · D1).

Mirrors cloud ``prewrite_cold_resume_settlement`` against the local OutboxStore:
hang-frame ``journal_entries`` are seeded at explicit seq first (cloud already has
them in PG), then durable ``*_resolved`` continues from the next seq **before**
the paused frame is consumed. The settlement payload may embed ``resume_frame``
as audit/control metadata (frameless continue-after-decision was abolished).
