"""WorkspaceBackend Protocol — the single seam for file + execution access.

Every filesystem / code-execution tool talks to a ``WorkspaceBackend`` instead
of touching ``Path`` directly. This is what lets one agent loop run against two
execution platforms without forking the engine:

- ``ServerWorkspace`` — files and execution live on the server (cloud mode).
- ``LocalWorkspace`` — files and execution live on the user's machine, reached
  over the desktop channel (local mode, added later).

Design constraints (pinned now so the contract never breaks under us):

- **Lean.** The backend owns exactly the pair that must share a platform: file
  I/O (axis 1) and code execution (axis 2). Persistence / snapshotting (axis 3)
  is deliberately NOT here — that is a turn-level storage policy handled by a
  separate ``StorageProvider``.
- **Typed failures.** Methods raise ``WorkspaceError`` subclasses instead of
  returning sentinel strings, so the (thin) tool layer can map each failure to
  its exact user-facing message and a remote ``LocalWorkspace`` can serialize
  the failure kind. The tool layer is responsible for catching these.
- **No absolute paths leak.** All inputs and outputs are workspace-relative
  (POSIX) paths; ``root_label`` is the only human-facing name for the root.
