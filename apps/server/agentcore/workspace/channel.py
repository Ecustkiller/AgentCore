"""WorkspaceChannel — route a LocalWorkspace op to the desktop and await it.

This is the generalized form of the tool-approval mechanism (``runtime/
approvals.py``): the server suspends on an ``asyncio.Future`` and a separate HTTP
request settles it. Approvals carry a one-shot *decision*; this channel carries a
full *request → response* op exchange so a server-side ``LocalWorkspace`` can run
file / execution ops on the user's real machine without the engine ever touching
a ``Path``.

Flow (one op):

1. ``LocalWorkspace`` calls ``WorkspaceChannel.request(op, args)``.
2. The channel registers a Future, emits a ``workspace_op_required`` SSE event,
   and awaits the Future (bounded by ``timeout_seconds``).
3. The bound desktop client runs the op against the local directory and POSTs the
   structured result to the ops resolve endpoint, which settles the Future.
4. The channel returns the op's ``value`` on success, or re-raises the original
   ``WorkspaceError`` subclass on failure — so the (unchanged) tool layer maps it
   to the same user-facing message it does for ``ServerWorkspace``.

State is in-process (single-worker posture, same as the approval gate); front
with Redis to scale to multiple workers (see ``config.py``). A result the client
never delivers fails as a ``WorkspaceIOError`` after the timeout and marks the
channel sticky-dead for the turn (sibling inflight settle + later ops fail-fast),
so a dropped desktop never hangs the turn on cascaded deadlines. Concurrent
desktop round-trips are capped (``max_inflight``, default 2); extras queue before
suspend, and queue wait rides the outer tool wall clock.

        independent 60s clock. ``timeout_ms`` is echoed on the SSE payload so the
        desktop can AbortSignal the in-flight IPC op; late settle after discard
        remains a stale 404 no-op.

        read-only mounts under ``external/<alias>/``); omit to use the workspace
        binding root. Does not change the conversation workspace binding contract.

        After the first real-op liveness timeout the channel stays sticky-dead: new
        requests raise immediately (no SSE) so a hung desktop cannot cascade into
        more 60s waits. ``probe_exec`` timeouts do not enter that sticky state.
