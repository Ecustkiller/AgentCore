"""WorkspaceChannel — route a LocalWorkspace op to the desktop and await it.

This is the generalized form of the tool-approval mechanism (``runtime/
approvals.py``): the server suspends on an ``asyncio.Future`` and a separate HTTP
request settles it. Approvals carry a one-shot *decision*; this channel carries a
full *request → response* op exchange so a server-side ``LocalWorkspace`` can run
file / execution ops on the user's real machine without the engine ever touching
a ``Path``.

Flow (one op):

1. ``LocalWorkspace`` calls ``WorkspaceChannel.request(op, args)``.
2. The channel registers a Future, emits a ``workspace_op_required`` SSE event,
   and awaits the Future (bounded by ``timeout_seconds``).
3. The bound desktop client runs the op against the local directory and POSTs the
   structured result to the ops resolve endpoint, which settles the Future.
4. The channel returns the op's ``value`` on success, or re-raises the original
   ``WorkspaceError`` subclass on failure — so the (unchanged) tool layer maps it
   to the same user-facing message it does for ``ServerWorkspace``.

State is in-process (single-worker posture, same as the approval gate); front
with Redis to scale to multiple workers (see ``config.py``). A result the client
never delivers fails as a ``WorkspaceIOError`` after the timeout, so a dropped
desktop never hangs the turn.
