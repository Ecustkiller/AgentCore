"""Local→cloud handoff — archive the bound local workspace, snapshot it (P2e / e1).

The first leg of the 本地→云 交接 bridge (双模式工作区设计 §四). A local-mode
conversation's files live on the user's machine, so the post-turn OSS backup
(``conversation/service``) deliberately skips local mode — there is nothing on the
server to snapshot. This path closes that gap on demand: it asks the bound desktop
to pack its whole authorized root into one archive over the existing
``WorkspaceChannel`` (the same transport the file ops use), unpacks it into a
server-side staging dir, and hands that to the configured ``StorageProvider`` —
reusing the entire cloud snapshot machinery (list / restore / download) verbatim.

Scope (e1): snapshot upload only — for backup / cross-device. Running a cloud team
on the snapshot (e2) and returning results as a diff/PR (e3) are separate, later
legs that build on the snapshot this produces.
