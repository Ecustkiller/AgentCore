"""File ownership ledger (C3 · 较强文件归属 / 交接式写权).

Two eras share one class:

* **Legacy (``engine_file_ownership_v2=False``)** — per-batch ``WriteCoordinator``:
  first successful ``file_write`` / ``file_append`` claims the path; concurrent
  unrelated siblings are refused; cross-batch overwrite is intentionally open.
* **C3 (default on)** — one ledger per coordination ``execution_id`` (session
  authority, snapshotted). **交接式写权**：

  - **Dispatch ``declare``** claims a free path; does **not** steal from an
    ancestor holder (downstream only records intent via plan artifacts). Nested
    lead→child drives opt into declare-time handoff explicitly. Cross-wave:
    declaring a path whose holder is already in ``completed_run_ids`` auto-
    transfers at dispatch (reviser after writer). ``ended_owners`` (ledger bypass,
    **not** progress ``completed_run_ids``) is treated the same for declare/claim.
  - **Write ``claim``** may hand off from an ancestor (downstream consolidates)
    or from an ``ended_owners`` holder (nested terminal ghost-lock fix).
  - **Completion handoff** moves owned paths to the unique dependent that listed
    the same artifact.
  - Explicit transfer: ``replaces_run_id`` / ``continue_from_run_id`` / ``force`` /
    ``resolve_escalation(transfer_ownership=true)`` / user structured裁决
    (user ownership card **only** when lock owner is still ``running``;
    completed/ended holders use same-seat replaces / declare·claim handoff —
    never NL「移交写权」).
  - Write-time ``claim`` refusals are remembered per refused run so escalate can
    attach ``ownership_paths`` even when the model paraphrases the conflict.

  Write tools consult the same book (``str_replace`` / ``write_section`` /
  delete / move included). Write ancestors = plan ``depends_on`` closure ∪
  nested ``parent_run_id``. Non-coordination batches still get a batch-local
  ledger for intra-batch mutual exclusion.

``code_execute`` workspace write-back is **not** hard-gated this period — only
observable; do not route it through :meth:`claim` without an explicit follow-up.
