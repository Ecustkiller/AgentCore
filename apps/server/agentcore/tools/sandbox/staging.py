"""Workspace staging for the gVisor sandbox — 产物写回 (copy-in / copy-out).

gVisor never gets a writable handle on the canonical workspace. Each execution
receives a per-run COPY of the workspace (staged under the OCI bundle dir and
bind-mounted **rw** at ``/workspace``); after the process completes, new or
changed regular files are copied back into the real workspace under explicit
caps, and the written paths are reported on ``ExecutionResult.written_files``
(auditable in logs + surfaced to the model in the tool output).

Why copy-in/copy-out instead of the alternatives (安全权限与治理.md §五):

- **runsc overlay**: the upper layer lives in the sandbox's internal filestore,
  not an extractable directory tree — artifacts could not be recovered after
  the container exits.
- **host overlayfs**: mounting requires privileges the non-root API container
  does not have.
- **direct rw bind of the real workspace**: loses blast-radius control (a
  crashed / hostile run can trash canonical files mid-write) and gives no
  audit surface of what an execution wrote.

Guards on the write-back leg: symlinks are never staged nor copied back, the
``.agentcore/`` internal zone (trash / metadata) is excluded both ways, every
destination must resolve inside the workspace root, and total bytes / file
count are capped (fail-visible: skipped files are counted and reported).
