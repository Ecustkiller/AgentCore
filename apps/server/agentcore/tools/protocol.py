@dataclass
class ToolResult:
    """Result of a tool execution.

    ``effect`` steers the ReAct loop and is the ONLY signal the engine acts on to
    decide whether the turn continues — never the tool's name or category (引擎纯化,
    设计 §8.5). The default ``ToolEffect.CONTINUE`` feeds ``output`` back to the
    model and loops; a terminal effect (``HANDOFF`` / ``INTERACT``) stops the loop
    because the tool already produced the turn's final user-facing answer, carried
    in ``final_text`` (so the model does not generate a second, duplicate reply).
    The CEO ``ask_user`` checkpoint sets ``INTERACT`` on a "stop" decision — its
    closing note is the ``final_text`` — so the turn ends gracefully in-band rather
    than via an SSE abort; ``delegate`` stays ``CONTINUE`` (its workers' products
    return to the CEO loop). ``final_text`` is persisted but NOT re-emitted and is
    exempt from ``output`` truncation (which only guards the model-facing
    ``output`` string).

    ``output_limit`` overrides the default model-facing truncation budget for the
    ``output`` string. Most tools leave it ``None`` (4000 chars); read-heavy tools
    (e.g. ``read_url``) raise it so a full page body is not truncated into invalid
    JSON. An over-budget output is HEAD+TAIL trimmed (``core.text.truncate_head_tail``)
    so trailing details survive rather than being head-chopped. ``final_text`` is never
    subject to this cap.

    ``citations`` carries structured web sources a tool consulted (each a
    ``{url, title, snippet, site}`` dict). Research tools (``web_search`` /
    ``read_url``) populate it so the engine can aggregate per-turn sources and the
    client can render source cards under the answer; non-web tools leave it
    ``None``. The dicts themselves are UI metadata; the engine additionally
    assigns each source a canonical number (its card index) and folds *that
    number* back into the tool's model-facing output, so the model can cite by a
    card-aligned number (see ``engine._annotate_tool_citations``).

    ``display`` is an OPTIONAL render-oriented payload, distinct from the
    model-facing ``output`` string: a tool that has a richer client rendering than
    plain text (``web_search`` → result cards, ``read_url`` → source card + body
    preview, ``code_execute`` → a terminal stdout/stderr view) populates it, and
    the desktop renders per tool — falling back to the ``output`` text when
    absent (工具结果富渲染). It rides the ``tool_use_end`` event → the process
    timeline / journal → the client (size-capped on the way,
    ``events._cap_display``), so a live turn and its reloaded twin render the
    same card. 形状是数据不是模式: the frontend keys the renderer off the tool
    name, so ``display`` is just the data that name's view needs (most tools
    leave it ``None``; edits like ``str_replace`` need nothing here — the client
    derives their diff from the call ``arguments`` it already has).
