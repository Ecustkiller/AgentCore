"""BoardChannel — route a batch of board ops to the desktop and await the result.

The board counterpart of ``workspace/channel.py``. ``board_ops`` (the server tool)
can't touch the user's whiteboard canvas directly — the canvas lives in the desktop
renderer — so it hands a structured op batch to this channel, which suspends the run
on the unified interaction bridge, emits a ``board_op_required`` SSE event, and awaits
the desktop's reply. The bound desktop converts ops → scene elements, applies them to
the open board, autosaves (CAS), and POSTs the result to the ops-resolve endpoint,
which settles the future.

State is in-process (single-worker posture, same as the approval gate / workspace
channel); front with Redis to scale to multiple workers. A reply the desktop never
delivers fails as a :class:`BoardOpError` after the timeout, so a dropped / closed
canvas never hangs the turn — the tool maps that to an error result the model can
recover from (tell the user, retry, or proceed).
