"""SQLAlchemy ORM model definitions, split by domain.

This ORM is the single source of truth for the AgentCore schema; structure is
applied via Alembic migrations (``alembic check`` must report zero drift).

This package was split out of a single ``models.py`` along the same domain seams as
``db/repositories`` (auth / billing / chat / conversations / devices / runs /
users). Importing the package imports every model module, so all tables
register on ``Base.metadata`` exactly as before (Alembic's ``env.py`` and
``Base.metadata.create_all`` see the full set). This ``__init__`` re-exports the full
class surface so the historical import path — ``from agentcore.db.models import X`` —
keeps working unchanged across the codebase; ``_new_uuid`` is re-exported because it
was a module-level name on the original module.
