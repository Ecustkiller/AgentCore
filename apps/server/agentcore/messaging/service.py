"""Messaging service: the 消息 page (找人 IM) business logic (消息IM.md).

Holds all IM policy so the HTTP layer stays thin and the repos do pure data
access:
- 任意搜人 visibility: exact-match search, minus self, blocked pairs, and users
  who opted out of discovery (``user_directory_settings.discoverable``);
- who-can-DM gate: opening a *new* dm with someone set to ``contacts`` is refused
  (no contact graph in P0 → effectively a hard opt-out), while the default
  ``anyone`` lets a stranger through as a *message request* (peer starts pending);
- send-message guards: must be a chat member (else 404, IDOR-safe), dm blocked
  pairs are refused, and a reply by the requested party clears their pending gate;
- list / unread / read-cursor / block / directory-settings management.

The service depends on repository instances (unit-testable with in-memory fakes)
and an optional realtime publisher (a seam — see ``events.py``) it calls to fan a
new message out to every member's live connections.
