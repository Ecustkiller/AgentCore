"""In-process realtime pub/sub for the 消息 page firehose (消息IM.md §四).

Single-worker fan-out: ``MessagingService`` persists a chat message, then publishes
it here, and the hub pushes it to every online recipient's SSE firehose
(``GET /v1/realtime``). State is in-process — the same single-worker posture the
rate limiter and approval registry already take; front with Redis / NATS pub-sub
to scale to multiple workers (§五, §八), behind the ``ChatEventPublisher`` seam.

A user may hold several live connections (multi-device): a publish fans the event
into every one. Each connection's queue is bounded — a connection too slow to
drain sheds its oldest undelivered events rather than growing without bound or
stalling the publisher; the client re-syncs anything it missed on reconnect via
the chat's ``last_read_message_id`` (离线补偿, §五), so a drop is recoverable, not
a lost message.
