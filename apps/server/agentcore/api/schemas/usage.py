"""Cost & usage (团队工资单 + 账户仪表盘) schemas.

Money is integer nano-USD (1 USD = 1e9) everywhere — never a float. The single
display-only CNY conversion rides on ``cny_total`` (server-side via CNY_PER_USD),
so the client never re-derives money. Token fields use the ledger short keys
(matching cost_events.tokens / RunState.usage), distinct from message_end's
legacy ``*_tokens`` SSE shape.
